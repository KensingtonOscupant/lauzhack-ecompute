# ECOmpute - compute during green time

## Inspiration
Almost every day, green energy goes to waste because of poor resource management. In times where climate change accelerates faster than ever, it is crucial to cut down on unnecessary energy consumption. Computing is a major factor here. 

## What it does

Our project allows users to schedule compute-intensive, and therefore energy-intensive, tasks in the cloud. It does this by predicting times at which most green energy is available, reducing carbon emissions particularly by leveraging times at which green energy is generated but not used.

## How we built it
We trained a support vector machine to forecast when green energy availability is the highest one week into the future based on current weather data and previous distributions between energy sources. Our predictions take one week of previous data to predict the upcoming three days. The model has an accuracy of ~88.9%.

We built a web app around it that allows the end user to schedule his jobs, e.g. training a resource-intensive machine learning model in the cloud. It provides insights into how much green energy is generated. How much of it is green time, when energy is overproduced and when the jobs requested have been scheduled.

## Challenges we ran into
Limitations of the frontend framework we used that we had to work around.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building a functioning scheduler.

## What we learned
The energy overproduction generated by wind in Western Europe is sometimes impressively large!

## What's next for ECompute
Further improving the accuracy of our models and integration with Docker to execute jobs.
